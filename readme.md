## About
This is new life of application for students who want to be a QA. It was initially developed in 2017 ‚ö†Ô∏è
to be tested by students, find bugs and report them.  
There are about 20+ bugs hidden inside ;)
‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏èThis app was the very first Djano app I've created so the code is bad and dirty. Really.
I'm surprised I could update it and make run locally so quickly. 
I don;t have a plan to refactor the code to make it pretty as it is working üòÇ

## Application Description
